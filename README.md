# rpc
A  rpc infra  with implementation for http. Purpose is to make it portable to multiple transports  and demonstrate Implementation through OOPS (in python)

Start the server first  execute the command
1> python server_main.py.
Then start the client
2> Python client_main.py

This will invoke two functions add and add and greetings on server side and return back the value.

The directory structure is as follows
1. core:  In here is the interface definition (and commmon implementation) for RPC Server and Client.
2  transport: In here lies the concrete implementation of the interfaces specified in core for http using post.
3. common: Contains some utilities/defintions that are used by all the components.


In case of a requirement, to support new transport layer (for eg native tcp), the core intefaces have to be implemented. 
Currently instantiation  of the concrete RPC class is hard coded  in the sample-example. When a new transport layer  needs to be supported, the  server_main.py and client_main.py 
has to be ported or a mechanism to dynamically instantiate the concrete classes, through config specific in config file needs to be incorporated
